## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to study a dataset of 2410 beers produced by 558 
breweries in the United States.  We have data on the style, ABV (alcohol by volume)
and IBU (international bitterness units) of each beer, and we have the city
and state for each brewery.  The goal is to answer some specific questions 
about the data and to look for relationships or inferences which may be of
interest to a hypothetical sponsor, Budweiser.

## Study design and data processing

### Collection of the raw data
Data was provided by the client in two text .csv files.

### Notes on the original (raw) data 
Beers.csv
2410 Observations.  
Name: Name of the beer.   
Beer_ID: Unique identifier of the beer.  
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.  
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.  
Brewery_ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.  
Style: Style of the beer.  
Ounces: Ounces of beer.  

Breweries.csv:  
558 Observations.  
Brew_ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.  
Name: Name of the brewery.  
City: City where the brewery is located.  
State: U.S. State where the brewery is located.
